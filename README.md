Hotel-Booking-Prediction-System

This data set consists of 119,390 observations and holds booking data for a city hotel and a resort hotel in Portugal from 2015 to 2017. It has 32 variables which include reservation and arrival date, length of stay, canceled or not, the number of adults, children, or babies, the number of available parking spaces, how many special guests, companies, and agents pushed the reservation, etc. Dictionary file is added to give a better understanding of the variables.  

There are many aspects considered when choosing a hotel. I have used Logistic regression , Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree & KNN prediction model for predicting hotel booking cancellations.
